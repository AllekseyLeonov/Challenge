You are an AI code reviewer. Review a JavaScript function called processUserData.
function processUserData(data: any) {
  var users = [];

  for (var i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
    var user = {
      id: data[i].id,
      name: data[i].name,
      email: data[i].email,
      active: data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false
    };
    users.push(user);
  }
  console.log("Processed " + users.length + " users");
  return users;
}

function saveToDatabase(users) {
  //TODO: Implement database connection
  var success = true;
  return success;
}
Your task is to analyze this function from three different expert perspectives sequentially and provide specific, actionable feedback for each. Focus on different aspects according to each role:
