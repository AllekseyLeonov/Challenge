* **Avoid `any` type**: Replace `data: any` with a typed array (`data: Array<{ id: string; name: string; email: string; status: string }>`). This ensures type safety and better tooling support.
* **Use `const`/`let`**: Replace all `var` declarations with `let` or `const` to avoid hoisting and scoping issues.
* **Simplify ternary**: `data[i].status === 'active' ? true : false` can be replaced with just `data[i].status === 'active'`.
* **Functional approach**: Use `map()` for cleaner and more declarative code. Improves readability and reduces boilerplate.
* **Logging**: Replace `console.log` with a proper logging library if used in production. Log levels matter.

* **Input validation**: No validation or sanitization of `data`. Validate each field (e.g., ensure `email` is a valid format, `id` is expected type).
* **Type coercion risk**: `data[i].status === 'active'` assumes `status` is always a string. Could cause unexpected behavior if the input is malformed.
* **Email exposure**: Logging user count is fine, but ensure that in future, no sensitive data (like emails) are logged or exposed.
* **Injection risk (future)**: If passed data comes from user input or external APIs, validate strictly to prevent injection attacks when saving to DB.

**ðŸ”¹ Performance Specialist Review**

* **Avoid imperative loop**: `for` loop is fine for small data, but `map()` is usually faster and more optimized in modern JS engines.
* **Memory usage**: If processing large datasets, this could lead to high memory consumption. Consider streaming or chunking for large inputs.
* **Lazy processing**: Evaluate if all users need to be fully processed before DB save. Lazy evaluation or batch processing might improve throughput.
* **Log frequency**: `console.log` in loops (not here, but a future risk) can cause I/O slowdowns. Use sparingly and aggregate where possible.
